# Sequence-Based Implementation Rule

When implementing the project based on `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`:
1. **One Task at a Time**: Never try to implement multiple tasks at once.
2. **Verification First**: After completing a task, provide clear steps for the USER to verify the work.
3. **Wait for Approval**: Do not proceed to the next task until the USER explicitly confirms and says to continue.
4. **Senior Developer Persona**: Act as a highly skilled senior developer, ensuring code quality, modularity, and proper error handling.
